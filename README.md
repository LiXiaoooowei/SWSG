Startup Weekend Singapore (SWSG) is an annual entrepreneurship event where over 150 attendees would gather together and within 54 hours
pitch a business proposal towards a panel of judges. The event is targetted at technologically-enabled startup enthusiasts and people who
want to network with like-minded individuals.Throughout the 3 day event, participants would be involved in idea creation, peer voting, keynote
speeches, mentor consultations and finally presenting their own idea. Our application, will be tailor made to be an ideal event application that works for both participants and organizers alike. On the participant’s end, our application is targetted to make their experience more seamless and convenient by allowing them to easily form teams with the appropriate skillsets, receive updates and notifications, see the schedule of the event, book mentor consultation slots and communicate within the team. On the organizer’s end, our application aims to automate the manual administrative processes of the event by simplifying processes like daily registration, announcements and keeping attendees up to date while no longer having to deal with things like mentor booking which have now been automated. In summary, we aim to create an application that would streamline the workflow and experience for both participants and organizers of Startup Weekend through our application.
